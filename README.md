# Advent of Code 🎄 (Multiple Years)

Welcome to my repository of solutions for the **Advent of Code** challenges! Advent of Code is an annual programming event featuring daily puzzles from December. This repository contains my personal solutions spanning multiple years, including **2024**, where I am solving the challenges in **Python** and **R**, the main tools used at my workplace, **Statistics Norway**.

## 🗂️ Structure

The repository is organized by year, with separate folders for each event:

```
/2024/
  /python/ - Solutions in Python
  /R/      - Solutions in R
/2023/
  /python/ - Solutions in Python (all stars)
...
```

## 🚀 Motivation

For 2024, my goal is to:
- Enhance my problem-solving skills in **Python** and **R**.
- Apply tools commonly used in real-world tasks at Statistics Norway.
- Have fun while tackling creative and challenging puzzles!

For previous years, you’ll find solutions in Python and other languages, showcasing my journey of growth and exploration as a programmer.
